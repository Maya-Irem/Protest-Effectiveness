In this repository you can find the source code for our research paper titled "To Protest or Not To Protest: Social Protest
Effectiveness Analysis using Machine Learning". 

The file is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. It includes everything from importing and preparing the dataset, performing
feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, outlier removal, deploying several different ML models to selecting the final 
model. 

We hope this research initiates a more thorough conversation on determining and predicting process efectiveness using both
social and computational tools.
